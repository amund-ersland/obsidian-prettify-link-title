# Prettify Links

An obsidian plugin to make a pretty name to links. The prettying can be configured to one or more regex-es, executed in order, in the settings tab.

This plugin is vibe coded and the author does only partly understand what happens. That said, it only uses obsidian packages and the author uses the plugin himself
